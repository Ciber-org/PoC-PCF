### Documentation

For all kind of documentations, we recommend using GitBook which internally uses Markdown language. 

GitBook is a tool for building beautiful books using Git and Markdown. It can generate your book in many formats like PDF, ePUB, mobi or as a website. It is open source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). GitBook.com is the online platform \([www.gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/)\) to create and host books built using GitBook format. You can publish and host books easily online. A desktop editor is [also available](https://www.gitbook.com/editor). 

**Markdown **is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain texteditor
