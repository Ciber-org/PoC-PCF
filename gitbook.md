### Documentation

---

For all kind of documentations, we recommend using GitBook which internally uses Markdown language.

**GitBook **is a tool for building beautiful books using Git and Markdown. It can generate your book in many formats like PDF, ePUB, mobi or as a website. It is open source available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). GitBook.com is the online platform \([www.gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/)\) to create and host books built using GitBook format. You can publish and host books easily online. A desktop editor is [also available](https://www.gitbook.com/editor).

**Markdown **is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain texteditor.

In order to record each and every step of this PoC, gitbook is used. A book named **Anything on PCF **is created under gitbook.com and published under Ciber-org organisation. The same is linked to github for the version controlling purpose. [https://github.com/Ciber-org/PoC-PCF](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ciber-org/anything-on-pcf/edit#) 

Create an account and get an invitation from the owner of the book to start contributing.
