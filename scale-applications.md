### Scale your Application

---

Scaling the application includes increasing your memory, disk space and/or increasing the running instances. _**Vertically scaling**_ an application changes the disk space limit or memory limit that Cloud Foundry applies to all instances of the application. 

_**Horizontally scaling**_ an application creates or destroys instances of your application. Incoming requests to your application are automatically load balanced across all instances of your application, and each instance handles tasks in parallel with every other instance. Adding more instances allows your application to handle increased traffic and demand
